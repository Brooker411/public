Progression Plan

Each week, we’ll increase either:
	•	Reps by 2–3
	•	Rounds by 1 every 2 weeks
	•	Time (for holds/planks) by 5–10 seconds

⸻

Day 1: Legs (Strength & Stability)

Week 1-2:
	•	Bodyweight squats – 3 x 10
	•	Glute bridges – 3 x 12
	•	Dumbbell Romanian deadlifts – 3 x 10
	•	Calf raises – 3 x 15
	•	Wall sit – 3 x 20 seconds

Progression:
Add reps or one round every 2 weeks. Hold light dumbbells for squats and calf raises from Week 3 onwards.

⸻

Day 2: Arms (Toning & Control)

Week 1-2:
	•	Bicep curls (light dumbbells) – 3 x 10
	•	Tricep kickbacks – 3 x 10 each arm
	•	Dumbbell hammer curls – 3 x 10
	•	Overhead tricep extensions – 3 x 10
	•	Wrist curls – 2 x 15

Progression:
Add reps every week. If you don’t feel enough resistance, slow down the tempo (3 seconds up, 3 seconds down).

⸻

Day 4: Back / Shoulders / Chest

Week 1-2:
	•	Dumbbell bent-over rows – 3 x 10
	•	Dumbbell shoulder press – 3 x 10

	•	Push-ups (on knees if needed) – 3 x 8
	•	Superman hold – 3 x 20 seconds

Progression:
Gradually increase push-up reps. Add a fourth round from Week 4. Use time-under-tension (slower movements) for more challenge.

⸻

Day 6: Light Cardio & Core (Endurance & Recovery)

Week 1-2:
	•	Jumping jacks – 3 x 30 seconds
	•	Push-ups – 3 x 8
	•	Sit-ups – 3 x 10
	•	Plank – 3 x 20 seconds
	•	Crunches – 3 x 15
	•	High knees – 3 x 30 seconds

Progression:
Increase time by 5–10 seconds or add 2–3 reps weekly. If needed, split into circuits for better flow.

⸻

Notes
	•	Warm-Up (5 mins before every session): Arm circles, bodyweight squats, shoulder rolls, light jogging or high knees in place.
	•	Cool Down (5 mins after): Stretch quads, hamstrings, triceps, shoulders, and chest. Breathe deeply.
